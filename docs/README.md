## __Guess The Number!
### __Project Description__
__*Scope and Functionality*__ - *Guess The Number!* is a single-player number guessing game. Each game, a number between 1 and 100 will be randomly generated and the player will be given the chance to guess which number it is. There is no limit on guesses, but those who use the least amount of guesses will be featured on the leaderboard for that session.\
To play, the player will enter a number between 1 and 100. The program will output that the guess was either too high or too low, and the player will be prompted to guess again. Once the number is guessed correctly, the program will congratulate the player and collect their name to add it (along with their score) to the leaderboard.

__*Motivation*__ - This program allows me to demonstrate my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by using what I've learned during my program at the University of Alberta.
